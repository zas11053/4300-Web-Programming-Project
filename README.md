# What is MyDateList?
MyDateList is an interactive, informative website for all romantics. Guest users may search for and view various date posts, and 
registered users may do these things in addition to favoriting a post, creating a post, and commenting. Date posts give the user
information on how to have the perfect date, such as location, price, food, and more.
