# 4300-Web-Programming-Project

Our groupâ€™s project will be an interactive, informative website for romantics called MyDateList. Through our website, users will first access a login page. Those with an account will sign in, while those without an account can create an account or continue as a guest. There will be a search bar for the user to search for date ideas by topic. Once a date idea is chosen, the user will be able to see the location of the date, pictures, a list of available activities, a description of the date, a rating, and how pricey the date is. Guests will be able to view all of these aspects, but users with an account will be able to add/delete/edit their own posts and add/delete their own comments. Users with an account can also view a list of all the posts they have made, change their username/password, and delete their account. Administrators for this website will be able to delete other accounts, comments, and date ideas.
